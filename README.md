# Money Map
Money Map has born from the necessity of a most practical and intuitive way to organize people’s financial health and spending mapping. It’s goal is to help people with simplicity about how to keep your money and how to spend it with conscience, without the needed to to understand technical terms or spend large time period to register them. Your proposal is to generate identification through the the system usage, without entry barriers, speaking the user language , making him realize that we want to understand him and, from this, generate specific solutions based on what he wants.
